JavaScript is a client side Language-

1st run your JS on any browser like chrome

Press - Ctrl + Shift + I ---> to open console of browser
and then perform your JS operations there for entry level--

example -
	1. console.log("Hello world");
	This above line will run & print 'Hello world' in console

	OR 
	2. alert("Hello world")
	This above line will also run & print 'Hello world' in console

* You can perform various operation on this console
like - multiplication, addition, division, subtraction etc..

and also you can perform certain actions using JS commands and funtions 
for ex -
document.querySelector(".gNO89b") ---by this command you can access elements on the page that you're in ..
This will give you following output -->

<input class="gNO89b" value="Google Search" aria-label="Google Search" name="btnK" type="submit" data-ved="0ahUKEwjA4IK-z-z1AhVGs1YBHf_UCBkQ4dUDCAc">
